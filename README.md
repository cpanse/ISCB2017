### Day 4

- Socio Economics
-> Phone Call scheduled Thursday, 27th of Oct.
- email: ingrid.fromm@bfh.ch
- phone: 031 910 2192 
- LI: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingrid-fromm-phd-8a74085b


Phone conference: Thu, 27.10.2016 (11.45 - 12:03)
- first get in touch: Week: 23.-27. January -> Tentatively fixed.. !!
- where do you see common ground? Where? -> aware of the problem?
--> somebody from ETH doing socio economics.. (Ralph?)
--> Overview of Socio Enomics .. 
- what do you do?
--> We get a simple presentation.. & I will send something similar.. 
- what kind of data do you have? --> we will find out from her presentations
- what kind of statistics do you do? --> we will find out from her presentations 
- After reading the presentation I will have a hard time to find common ground

Presentation content (I. Fromm):
- Regional aspects with respect to production over the past decades
- Which varieties are grown where? 
- Which aspects are important for growing this variety and not the other
